 ## 🎯 Pre-Game Rules & Requirements  
### for **M & D — Mind & Diagnosis**

To ensure the highest quality gameplay, all players must follow these rules **before** the session begins:

---

### 📚 1) Basic Familiarity with the Case Topic
A few days before the session, the **case theme** will be announced.  
Players are expected to do a brief review or light study on the topic so they can contribute meaningful psychological analysis during the game.

---

### 📝 2) Confirmed Attendance
This is a **role-dependent** game, and the absence of even one player can break the narrative and disrupt the diagnostic process.  
All players must confirm their attendance **at least 24 hours** before the session.

❗ **Absence, lateness, and disorder are not acceptable.**

### 🎭 3) Respect for Roles & Story Flow
Each player holds a **unique role** and **a piece of the puzzle**.  
To keep the investigation coherent, players must:

- Stay in character  
- Collaborate actively  
- Avoid jokes or interruptions unrelated to the story  

Breaking the narrative flow weakens the game’s psychological depth.
