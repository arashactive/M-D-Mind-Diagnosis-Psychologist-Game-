 ## 🎯 Pre-Game Rules & Requirements  
### for **M & D — Mind & Diagnosis**

To ensure the highest quality gameplay, all players must follow these rules **before** the session begins:

---

### 📚 1) Basic Familiarity with the Case Topic
A few days before the session, the **case theme** will be announced.  
Players are expected to do a brief review or light study on the topic so they can contribute meaningful psychological analysis during the game.

---

### 📝 2) Confirmed Attendance
This is a **role-dependent** game, and the absence of even one player can break the narrative and disrupt the diagnostic process.  
All players must confirm their attendance **at least 24 hours** before the session.

❗ **Absence, lateness, and disorder are not acceptable.**

---

### 🎭 3) Respect for Roles & Story Flow
Each player holds a **unique role** and **a piece of the puzzle**.  
To keep the investigation coherent, players must:

- Stay in character  
- Collaborate actively  
- Avoid jokes or interruptions unrelated to the story  

Breaking the narrative flow weakens the game’s psychological depth.

---

### 🎲 4) Game Mechanics & Dice Rules
Major decisions rely on a combination of:

- **Roleplay**
- **Psychological reasoning**
- **Dice rolls**

Risky actions require a **Luck Test**, and dice may be rolled **only when the DM announces it**.

---

### 🔇 5) Focused & Quiet Environment
The game takes place inside a university classroom.  
Please maintain full concentration:

- Phones on silent  
- No unnecessary movement  
- No side conversations  

---

### 🧠 6) Mental Preparedness & Cooperation
The goal is more than entertainment — it’s about practicing:

- Psychological analysis  
- Critical thinking  
- Collaborative diagnosis  

Active listening, respect, and full participation are essential.

---

### 🔥 7) Confidential Role Information
Each player receives **secret information** related to the case.  
Until the DM authorizes sharing:

- Do **not** reveal your information  
- Do **not** discuss your clues outside the game  
- Do **not** leak story details to other players  

This mystery is core to the gameplay.

---


## 🎬 Game Overview & Start  
### 🎭 Role of the **DM — Director of Mind**

In **Mind & Diagnosis (M&D)**, the **DM** is the architect of the world, the keeper of secrets, and the guide through every layer of the psychological mystery.

The DM is responsible for:

- 🎥 **Describing scenes** and setting the emotional tone  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Portraying the environment, characters, and the patient**  
- ❓ **Answering player questions** (only within the limits of the story)  
- 🧩 **Releasing clues gradually** as players progress  
- 🔄 **Managing the flow of the case**, pacing events and revelations  
- 🔐 **Protecting the core secrets** until the right moment  

The DM holds **about 60% of the case puzzle**, while the rest is scattered among player roles.  
No one knows the full truth except the DM —  
and the players must collaborate, analyze, and uncover the psychological narrative piece by piece.

This is where the investigation begins…  
Welcome to the mind.

## 🧬 Player Roles (Role-Based Play)

Each player receives a **unique role**, and these roles are more than labels —  
they come with **real behavioral rules, limitations, and exclusive information**.

### Example Roles:

---

### 🔇 Silent Neuron  
A player who **cannot speak** at all.  
They may communicate **only through physical gestures, expressions, or movement**.

---

### 🔥 Disease Effect  
The only player who **experiences the symptoms internally**.  
They provide **raw subjective data**, but cannot access objective or scientific explanations.

---

### 🟡 Emotional Analyst  
This player may **talk only about emotions, tone, and affect**.  
They cannot reference scientific terminology or diagnostic labels.

---

### 🔵 Physiological Observer  
The only player who can **see bodily signs and physiological indicators**.  
They report physical manifestations others cannot perceive.

---

### 🧩 Collaboration is Essential  
Each role carries a **unique fragment of the puzzle**.  
No single player can reach a diagnosis alone —  
the full picture emerges **only when every role contributes actively**.

This structure forces teamwork, critical thinking, and multidimensional psychological interpretation.

---

## 📘 How the Game Begins

The session unfolds in a structured, story-driven way. Below are the core steps that kick off every case:

### 1) The DM sets the scene
The story opens with a psychological scenario or clinical case: a patient, a room, a strange mental landscape, or a half-remembered memory.  
From the very first moment, players are immersed in a narrative and clinical atmosphere created by the DM.

### 2) Roles are assigned
Each player receives their role card and role-specific limitations.  
Role cards contain confidential clues and behavioral constraints that shape how each player can interact during the game.

### 3) The puzzle is activated
The DM reveals an initial set of clues. Players then use their roles to:

- **Gather information** from available sources and role interactions  
- **Connect clues** and look for patterns across fragments  
- **Analyze the patient's behavior or the presented environment** from their role perspective  
- **Form step-by-step hypotheses** and iteratively refine diagnostic reasoning

As the session progresses, the DM will release additional clues, allow dice-based attempts to unlock memories or details, and guide the pacing so the team can gradually assemble the full case.

--- 

## 🎲 The Role of Dice in the Game

Dice introduce a blend of **chance + skill**, making the game dynamic, unpredictable, and psychologically engaging.

Dice rolls are used for:

- **Attempting to access hidden clues**
- **Asking sensitive or high-impact questions to the DM**
- **Entering or unlocking the patient’s memories**
- **Discovering connections between symptoms**
- **Determining success or failure of specific actions**
- **Revealing new sections of the story**

Every successful or failed roll can **change the entire trajectory of the case**.

A lucky roll may unlock a crucial part of the narrative earlier than expected.  
A poor roll may create obstacles, confusion, or temporarily lock an important clue.

The uncertainty keeps the investigation alive—  
and ensures that no two sessions ever unfold the same way.

---

## 🌀 Story-Driven Experience

**M & D** is not just a game —  
it's a *living interactive film*.

Players make choices…  
The DM narrates and shapes the world…  
Dice rolls shift destiny…  
And ultimately, the group must deliver a **final psychological diagnosis** just like a real clinical team.

Every decision, every clue, and every action shapes the evolving narrative,  
making each session a unique psychological journey.

## 🔇 Silent Neuron  
### 🧩 Role Description

The **Silent Neuron** represents a neural unit inside the patient’s mind.  
It plays a crucial role in transferring information between different parts of the narrative and the patient’s memory—but unlike other players, it **cannot speak at all**.

All interaction must be done **non-verbally**, through gestures, movements, symbolic actions, props, or physical cues.

This limitation forces the team to rely on observation, pattern recognition, and interpretation—mirroring how real neurons communicate without words.

The Silent Neuron can convey hints, emotional signals, or fragments of memory through:

- Gestures  
- Body movement

This creates a layer of indirect, interpretive communication that the team must decode.

---

#### **2) Access to the Patient’s Short-Term Memory**
The Silent Neuron is the **only role** with direct access to the patient’s memory from the last **30–60 seconds** of mental time.

They can transmit this information through non-verbal cues, symbol movements, or gestures.

---

#### **3) Insight Roll Bonus (+2)**
If the team correctly decodes the Neuron’s signals, they gain:

- **+2 Bonus to Insight Rolls**  
  (used to unlock sensitive or critical clues)

This reinforces teamwork and rewards paying attention.

---

#### **4) Team Coordination Catalyst**
Players must actively:

- Watch the Neuron  
- Decode movements  
- Discuss interpretations  

Incorrect interpretation may lead to **partial or misleading information**, impacting the diagnostic path.

---

### 🔒 Special Limitations

- **No speaking allowed** — even if the DM asks a direct question.
